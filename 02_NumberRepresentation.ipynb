    "#### Function conditioning\n",
    "\n",
    "A mathematical function $f(x)$ is well-conditioned if $f(x+\\epsilon)\\simeq f(x)$ for all small perturbations $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the function $f(x)$ is **well-conditioned** if the solution varies gradually as the input varies. For a well-conditioned function, small pertubations in the input result in small effects in the output. However, a poorly-conditioned problem only needs some small perturbation to have large effects. For example, inverting a nearly singluar matrix (a matrix whose determinant is close to zero) is a poorly conditioned problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm stability\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a computer algorithm $g(x)$ that represents the mathematical function $f(x)$. $g(x)$ is **numerically stable** if $g(x+\\epsilon) \\simeq f(x)$ and it is called **unstable** if large changes in the output are produced. Analyzing an algorithm for stability is more complicated than determining the condition of an expression, even if the algorithm simply evaluates the expression. This is because an algorithm consists of many basic calculations and each one must be analyzed and, due to roundoff error, we must consider the possibility of small errors being introduced in every computed value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerically unstable algorithms tend to amplify approximation errors due to computer arithmetic over time. If we used an infinite precision numerical system, stable and unstable alorithms would have the same accuracy. However, as we see below (e.g. variance calculation), when using floating point numbers, algebrically equivalent algorithms can give different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we need both a well-conditioned problem and an algorihtm with sufficient numerical stabilty to obtain reliably accurate answers. In this case, we can be sure that $g(x) \\simeq f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most of the cases, the solution to stability issues is solved by properly redefining the function as in the example above and below."
